Varkas Koss (Var),"Vi's younger twin brother (by four minutes!). During the rebellion, after the loss of the rebel base on Hoth, Var volunteered for what was known even then as a near-certain suicide mission--the Outbount Reclamation Initiative (ORI). Overconfident in his abilities as a fighter and combat engineer, Var eagerly went on the mission to bring recognition to his family (or to himself from his family?). Unfortunately, the mission was the predicted disaster, and Var was long thought to be dead as the rebellion refocused their efforts on the emerging threat of the second Death Star.

However, Var survived and returned as the powerful Lord Var and leader of the enigmatic Order of the Darkstar--a Dark side cult dedicated to following the crystalline Darkstar in order to stop the Krynn and amass power for their own ends. However, Var's ascension to leader did not sit well with some more traditional members of the cult. They believed Var took them away from their intended purpose of fighting the Krynn by all means--alleging that Var was accumulating power only for himself. Furthermore, they believed Var was polluting the Order's purity by partnering with outside parties, like Thrawn's 7th Fleet, the Chimaera legion.

When Vi released Jaxsen Tarn, a proponent of the Order's old ways, Jaxsen nominated Vi as his champion to duel Var in the Ritual of Kaggath--a fight to the death. Vi accepted, but she secretly had no intention at all of killing her brother and told her wife to plan accordingly. Kavin and Cho also planned accordingly, so Vi fought Var in their fated duel at a disadvantage using her mother's lightsaber in order to stun her lost brother and nearly won. Var then manifested supernatural power--presumably empowerment or even possession by the Darkstar itself--and drove Vi underground and nearly killed her until her crew/family intervened. Khay rushed in and healed her injured wife while Kavin and Cho created enough chaos to give us a fighting chance to actually escape with Var, the estranged fallen twin brother, intact.",,var.png,You don't want to know what those tattoos mean.,people

Darkstar Tree,"A species of tree found on the forest planet Kella and worshipped by the Wellik. The tree has natural connections to the Force of the planet and is consequently highly prized as material for a manner of things, from furniture to lightsaber hilts. The Black Sun group had interests in harvesting these trees via mechanized and slave labor until we (at the behest of Cho) put a stop to it all.","Overview:

The Darkstar Tree, exclusive to Kella, a moon shrouded in dense forests, is a botanical marvel. Known for its imposing stature, striking dark black wood, and reddish-gold leaves that shimmer under Kella's moons, these trees are akin to the mythical titans of folklore, towering over the landscape like ancient guardians.

Sacred Connection:

To the native Wellick, a sentient humanoid deer-like species, the Darkstar Tree holds profound spiritual significance. Interwoven with the Force, these trees are revered as living symbols of Kella's spirit. They form the heart of Wellick culture, serving as sacred sites for communal rituals and tranquil spaces for meditation.

Ecological Role:

The Darkstar Tree plays a pivotal role in maintaining Kella's ecological equilibrium. Its extensive root systems prevent soil erosion and sustain a unique ecosystem, home to several species found nowhere else in the galaxy.

Illegal Exploitation:

Under the oppressive control of the Black Suns Cartel, the Darkstar Tree faces severe threat due to rampant, unregulated exploitation. The Black Suns, driven by greed, have turned Kella into a hub for illegal logging, harvesting the rare Darkstar Wood for the black market. This lucrative trade is a direct violation of New Republic laws, but enforcement is virtually non-existent on Kella, leaving the moon's fate hanging in a precarious balance.

Devastating Impact:

The unchecked harvesting of Darkstar Wood has led to widespread deforestation, disrupting the ecological harmony and endangering the future of both the Darkstar Tree and the native Wellick. As the Cartel continues to strip Kella of its natural resources, the survival of this once-thriving moon hangs in uncertainty.

Cultural Tragedy:

For the Wellick, the destruction of the Darkstar Trees is not just an ecological disaster but a devastating blow to their cultural identity and spiritual beliefs. The desecration of these sacred groves symbolizes the loss of their heritage and a direct attack on their way of life.

Conclusion:

The plight of the Darkstar Tree and Kella serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of unchecked exploitation and the need for galactic awareness and intervention. As the moon's natural beauty and cultural heritage teeter on the brink of extinction, the Darkstar Tree remains a poignant emblem of what is at stake – the preservation of a unique ecosystem and the survival of an ancient culture intimately connected to it.",darkstar_tree.png,Valuable redwoods.,objects

When we rescued him, he nominated Vi as his champion in the Ritual of Kaggath, which he had the right to invoke, in order to depose Var's claim on leadership of the enigmatic cult. He did this despite our informing him that we encountered and fought his daughter, Elara Tarn, who apparently never returned from her mission to claim the vergeance star map. When it became clear Vi was going to break the Ritual of Kaggath's rules and accept interference and refuse to kill her opponent, he appeared to still want to work with us on at least escaping the potential wrath of the mad cult.",,jaxsen_tarn.png,"Sorry we fucked over your daughter, it was in self defense.",people

She was originally from Ryloth, but her family's farm was forcefully taken over by local bully Thrax over a water rights dispute.

Kella,"Beautiful but obscure forest world. While it used to be home to lush forests filled with Darkstar trees, recent logging operations led by Freya Sett of Black Suns mercenary group have been using the local Welliks as a slave labor force to harvest and destroy their beautiful yet lucrative home. Having a personal vendetta against Freya, Cho led us to liberate the slaves and personally killed Freya, but the cost of such a crusade took the largest toll on Khay, who shot down a luxury liner hoping to aid the effort. Even accordin gto Mother Ukada it was the right thing to do, but Khay will always have her conflicted doubts about the matter.","Overview:

Kella, a lush and vibrant moon, is home to the Wellick, a sentient species of deer-like humanoids. This serene moon is renowned for its dense, mystical forests, teeming with diverse flora and fauna. The most notable are the Darkstar Trees, known for their spiritual significance and connection to the Force, as well as their valuable dark hardwood.

Current Crisis:

The Black Sun Cartel, exploiting Kella's resources, has initiated large-scale harvesting operations, primarily targeting the Darkstar Trees. This rampant deforestation is not just a commercial venture; it's a systematic destruction of the moon's ecosystem. The environmental impact is catastrophic, with widespread devastation affecting not only the forests but also the native wildlife and the Wellick communities.

Impact on the Environment and Inhabitants:

The relentless harvesting has led to a drastic change in the landscape, with once-thriving forests turning into barren wastelands. The destruction of the Darkstar Trees disrupts the natural balance, endangering numerous species and destabilizing the ecosystem. The Wellick, whose culture and way of life are intricately tied to the forests, face an existential crisis. Their sacred connection to the Darkstar Trees and the land is being severed, leading to cultural erosion and a loss of identity.

Key Figures in the Operation:

- Cell Leader Freya Sett: A former Imperial officer, now a high-ranking member of the Black Sun Cartel. Known for her ruthless approach, Freya Sett oversees the exploitation of Darkstar Wood, showing little regard for the indigenous population or the environmental impact. Her harsh methods and disregard for the Wellick's cultural values have intensified the conflict on Kella.

- Jerex Croft: The head of operations on Kella Station, Jerex Croft is responsible for the day-to-day management of the harvesting. He resents Freya Sett's oversight, viewing her as an outsider who complicates his operations. His contempt for her methods and her background as a former Imperial adds tension within the ranks of the operation.

Resistance and Hope:

In the face of this overwhelming adversity, the Wellick, along with sympathetic factions, have started to organize resistance efforts. Covert operations to sabotage the harvesting machinery and rescue enslaved Wellick are becoming more frequent. The situation on Kella is dire, but the resolve of its inhabitants to protect their home offers a glimmer of hope in these dark times.

Conclusion:

The struggle for Kella is not just a local issue but a poignant example of the larger conflicts that plague the galaxy. It's a battle between exploitation and preservation, between the greed of powerful factions and the resilience of native populations. The fate of Kella and its inhabitants hangs in the balance, a testament to the enduring struggle for freedom and dignity in the face of oppression.",kella.png,The beautiful forests of Kella.,planets and regions

Region: Just outside Hutt Space

Planet Type: Terrestrial

Climate: Temperate

Terrain: Diverse; primarily agricultural with mountain ranges, valleys, and forested hills
Key Cities: Orvos Prime (Capital and Main Metropolitan Center), Tarrin (Secondary City and Black Market Hub)

Government: New Republic Governance with Local Elected Officials

Population: Mixed; predominantly Human with a significant representation of Twi'leks, Rodians, and other Outer Rim species

Economy: Agriculture-driven with contributions from trade, technology, and black market dealings

Exports: Agricultural produce, textiles, technology parts

Imports: Machinery, luxury goods, spices

Allegiance: New Republic

New Republic Base: Fortitude Outpost (Strategically located within proximity to Orvos Prime for logistic support and rapid deployment)

Black Market Influence: While the New Republic maintains official governance, the proximity to Hutt space has allowed for a thriving black market, primarily run through Tarrin. Smugglers, bounty hunters, and traders frequent the city, dealing in everything from rare artifacts to embargoed goods.

Description: 

New Orvos is a beacon of New Republic ideals in the Outer Rim. It's lush and fertile lands are dotted with vast stretches of farmland that feed not only its population but also contribute to the food supply in the region. However, the planet's serene exterior belies the bustling activity of its metropolitan centers.

Orvos Prime, the capital city, is a hub of political activity and houses the main base of New Republic operations on the planet. It is characterized by its orderly city planning, well-maintained public facilities, and the presence of New Republic troops that ensure the safety and upholding of the law.

Tarrin, on the other hand, is the polar opposite. Nestled among the mountain ranges, it is the unofficial capital of the planet's black market. It’s a city where credits speak louder than allegiances, and where the New Republic's influence is challenged by the shadowy underworld powers that profit from the proximity to Hutt-controlled territories.

New Orvos's location makes it a strategic asset to the New Republic, providing a foothold near Hutt space from which to extend their influence into the Outer Rim. The presence of the New Republic military base, Fortitude Outpost, underscores the planet's importance. The base is a center for reconnaissance missions, a deterrent against Hutt incursions, and a refuge for those fleeing the lawlessness of the Outer Rim.

Despite the undercurrents of illicit dealings, New Orvos is a planet of opportunity. It's a place where one can witness the juxtaposition of the New Republic's ideals against the practical realities of Outer Rim living, where the untamed spirit of the frontier meets the order and organization of the New Republic's vision for the future.",new_orvos.png,New Orvos from orbit.,planets and regions

Wellick,"A sentient, mostly tribal society of humanoid deer-like folk. They value their horns as a sign of status. Unfortunately, the Black Suns forced these horns to be blunted during their forced slavery. Under the direction of Cho, we eventually liberated them from their oppressors. They had their own esoteric Force traditions, as they were naturally connected with the planet which, having such a Darkstar tree presence, was naturally connected to the Force in its own unique way.","Appearance and Physical Attributes:

The Wellick are a unique species of humanoid deer-like creatures, standing shorter than the average human. Their most striking feature is a set of prominent horns, a symbol of pride and status in their culture. These horns are typically long and intricately branched, resembling those of terrestrial deer. Their bodies are covered in a shaggy coat, providing camouflage and protection in their forested environment. Their faces blend human and deer characteristics, with large, expressive eyes and a gentle demeanor. Despite their sturdy build, they are agile, adapted for navigating the dense forests of their moon, Kella.

Culture and Society:

The Wellick are deeply spiritual and live in small tribal communities scattered throughout the remaining woods of Kella. Their society values harmony with nature, evident in their sustainable living practices and reverence for the flora and fauna of their moon. The sacred Darkstar Trees hold immense spiritual significance, believed to be connected to the Force, guiding their philosophy and rituals.

Art and music are integral to Wellick culture, with traditional songs and dances performed during significant celestial events and communal gatherings. Their art often depicts the natural beauty of Kella and the mystical aspects of the Darkstar Trees.

Current Situation:

Kella, once a serene forested moon, is now under threat. The Black Suns cartel has enslaved many Wellick to exploit the moon's resources, particularly the Darkstar Trees, valued for their fine dark hardwood. This rampant deforestation is destroying the Wellick's habitat and disrupting their way of life.

In a cruel display of dominance, the cartel has mandated the blunting of the Wellick's horns, a devastating blow to their cultural identity. This act has not only physically harmed them but also deeply wounded their spirit, as their horns are a source of individual and communal pride.

Resistance and Resilience:

Despite these hardships, the Wellick are not passive victims. Covert resistance movements have begun to form, aiming to sabotage the cartel's operations and protect what remains of their sacred forests. These groups often operate in secrecy, using their intimate knowledge of the terrain to their advantage.

The Wellick's connection to the Force, though not as pronounced as in some species, manifests in a profound intuition and a deep understanding of their environment. This spiritual connection empowers them in their struggle, providing hope and resilience in these dark times.

Outlook:

The future of the Wellick is uncertain. With their moon being slowly ravaged, they face the potential loss of their home and culture. Yet, their enduring spirit and deep connection to Kella and the Force offer a glimmer of hope. This critical period in their history is not just a fight for survival, but a battle for the soul of their civilization.","wellick.png,wellick2.png","A typical Wellick before the Black Suns occupation.,Haggard Wellick during the Black Suns occupation.",people
