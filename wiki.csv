Entry,body
Kiara,Human commander who really doesn't like us.
Armando Quanti,"Weequay information broker who helped us on the start of our journeys. Working for the Republic, he has since been reassigned."
The Fuckit-Bucket,"Our YT-2000 freighter that's seen its share of pain. Kavin keeps her together, with spit and wishes sometimes, but somehow she's always pulled through. To Vi's great annoyance, the protocol droid who registered their name in the database as the Duckit-Bucket due to autocorrect, so their designation is DB-1. Though sometimes, since falling in with some rough crowds and needing to hide their past bounties or affiliations, they use a second transponder under the name ""The Spicy Rancor."""
Lambda,"Former ISB agent, but still very young. She defected with Artie, trying to sell her information to the highest bidder--maybe the Black Sun?"
Voss Prime,"Outer Rim planet known for blush manufacturing. Mostly a volcanic moon orbiting a gas giant, Voss Prime still has rich plant life in a tropical climate--with the occasional earthquakes."
Karris Collective,Cartel running Voss Prime
R3 (Artie),Black astromech droid originally belonging to former ISB agent codenamed Lambda.
Morven Rask,"Force master of the Ashani tradition. Tried to claim the Eon Codex for himself to fight the Krynn, but instead offered to train Khay and her crew in his ways with the hope they would join his cause. "
Cerberus,"Name of the Imperial project Dr. Starblade worked on, with the goal to clone the Emperor. The result of this project was encountered on Bestu when Khay confronted the source of at least some of her Force connection, yes in the form of a cybernetic Emperor (somehow). While Khay, Vi, and Kavin escaped this monster, they never quite saw a body..."
Dr. Nariyah Reyan,Genetic engineer who worked on Cerberus.
Dr. Voss Henson,Neurologist who worked on Cerberus.
Dr. Jaxon Kline,Clone tech expert who worked on Cerberus.

Nihlus Veil,Extremely difficult patch of space with little life--but still with some planets lost to time.
Grand Admiral Thrawn (Mitth'raw'nuruodo),"Chiss Grand Admiral of the Empire, in direct command of his flagship--the ISD Chimaera, and the 7th Imperial Fleet."
Grand Admiral Rae Sloane,Human woman in command of the ISD Leviathan and the 3rd Imperial Fleet. Her legion wears a shark logo with the number 3 on their armor with a dark grey and crimson trim palette.

ISD Vengeance,"Flagship of Admiral Valeria Drayk and the former 12th Fleet, now the Shadow's Hand."
Shadow's Hand,"Group of Imperials working under Admiral Valeria Drayk. Their actual status in the Empire is dubious at best to our knowledge, as they do not operate in traditionally Imperial ways."
Admiral Valeria Drayk,"Human female leading the Shadow's Hand fleet--formerly the 12th Imperial Fleet. Her flagship, the ISD Vengeance, is the one that pursued us to Votaris seeking the Eon Codex."
Eon Codex,
Eilin Keldan,Daughter of a galaxy-reknowned scholar of ancient Sith civilization. She has a protector droid named Zeke
Zeke,Eilin's protector droid.
Tholothian Crest,Rask's training facility.
Ashani Way,Force tradition emphasizing the continuous nature of the Force. They view the light and dark as the same concept with different aspects and seek to pursue balance and understanding of the entire concept.
The Flow of Balance,"Ashani meditation practice, emphasizing the balance between light and dark (resembling IRL Tai Chi)."
Krynn,"Ancient insectoid race, strong in the Dark side of the Force. Worshippers of the ""Dark Star"", they believe all who use the Force are stealing from their god. They are a mostly unknown threat to the galaxy at large,hailing literally from the Unknown Regions, but may prove its undoing if left unchecked regardless of their obscurity. "
Order of the Darkstar,"Secret cabal of Force sensitives, powerful in the Dark Side and opposed to the Krynn, who use their own lightsabers crafted from the Darkstar itself--but is it corrupting them to work for the Krynn unwittingly? The Order is lead by Varkas Koss (Var)--Vi's twin brother long thought to be dead."
Varkas Koss (Var),"Vi's younger twin brother (by four minutes!). During the rebellion, after the loss of the rebel base on Hoth, Var volunteered for what was known even then as a near-certain suicide mission. Overconfident in his abilities as a fighter and combat engineer, Var eagerly went on the mission to bring recognition to his family (or to himself from his family?). Unfortunately, the mission was the predicted disaster, and Var was long thought to be dead as the rebellion refocused their efforts on the emerging threat of the second Death Star."
Project Khaybear,"Secret project lead by Dr. Starblade to clone the daughter she lost, Khaylia. Using resources from Cerberus, she worked to clone Khay perfectly, down to her memories. While successful, she had to recruit the help Nala Se, a Kaminoan. Nala Se ultimately betrayed Dr. Starblade's trust and made modifications to Khaylia's genome allowing her to break free of the Imperial conditioning Dr. Starblade was implanting."
Nala Se,Kaminoan cloning expert recruited by Dr. Starblade to help in Project Khaybear. She may be the only one responsible for Khay's breaking free of Dr. Starblade's attempt to implant Imperial conditioning into Khay's genome.
Heirloom Tea Set,An heirloom to Khay from her mother--originally a gift from Grand Admiral Thrawn himself. She often drank with this set during her short breaks trying to 'resurrect' her daughter.

Ranara,"Young, dark-haired human who is a visionary at the Ashani training facility."
Rhyssa,Togruda student at the Ashani training facility.
Ilsan,Zabrak student at the Ashani training facility.
Jenna,"Human female acolyte in the Order of the Dark Star. She was killed by Vi in the failed assassination of a Senator on Coruscant, with her Zabrak master only getting away with one of her lightsabers. Using psychometry on the other one, Khay discovered Var was the leader of the Order of the Dark Star and had her first visions of the Krynn before even knowing what they were."
Trynn Starblade,"The ultimate conclusion to Project Khaybear. After Khay's perceived betrayal of the Empire during the Battle of Endor, Dr. Starblade succeeded in undoing the alterations to Khay's genome made by the Kaminoan Nala Se. This new clone was named Trynn, after another name Dr. Starblade had considered for Khaylia. Finally loyal to the Empire, Dr. Starblade eventually confessed the truth to Trynn, the results of which we still don't know. Trynn went on to lead Crimson Ghost Squad, which was the group that worked with the Pykes during the assault on the Olympia that nearly killed countless people on Coruscant. She wasn't completely different from Khay though--she still did have an 'alien' girlfriend."
Xeran Varros,"Imperial Force sensitive, possibly an Inquisitor, working for the Shadow's Hand and Admiral Drayk. "
Shadow Disciples,"Followers of Xeran Varros, our primary attackers during the frantic escape from the moon-bit-shower that rained down on the Eon Codex's location on Votaris."
Nali Darkstar,"TIE pilot whose helmet stayed on Endor's moon long after the battle where Vi and Khay met. Years later during a romantic getaway, they found the helmet while wandering through the forest for a picnic."
General Barris,"Current commanding officer, though he's mostly cut us loose for now--we work better without rules. We were originally suspicious of him, and Doc was able to let us know he commanded a squad known as the Reapers during the rebellion. However, since our first meeting we've mostly come to trust him--especially since he helps shield us from Kiara."
