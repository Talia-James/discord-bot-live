# discord-bot-live

Live version of the bot in discord-bot-tools for personal use. Some functions are modified frequently and/or hardcoded and thus may not be reflected in the other folder.

The bot has evolved to fill many functions over time. It started as a fun way to manage roles in a server, but now I use it to manage several functions for virtual tabletop roleplaying game sessions, namely for Chaosium's Call of Cthulhu system and Fantasy Flight Game's Star Wars Genesys system.

For the latter, most information is sourced from https://star-wars-rpg-ffg.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_RPG_(FFG)_Wiki but may be incorrect. The skills, abilities, and other information are not yet complete, as I have only filled out the relevant skills that my party uses so far.
