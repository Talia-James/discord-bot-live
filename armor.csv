Powered Capacitive Armour,1,1,3000,4,2,8,Yes,"This is a popular item from the line of lightweight armour types, offering flexible protection at all times. However, it contains a power source, that when active, locks the plates in place. May power up armour as a maneuver, gaining defense +1 and soak +1. However, lose free maneuver."
CF-9 Naval Flight Suit,1,1,1200,3,2,6,Yes,"These flight suits are produced specifically for clone trooper pilots. They provide the necessary armour for combat situations where the pilot is left without their vehicle, but not too much that it restricts necessary movement for flight.  Includes built-in respirator. Remove 1 setback dice from Piloting (Space and Planetary) checks added due to danger or stress of the action."
Mountaineer Armour,1,1,1800,3,2,6,No,This is a thick yet flexible and lightweight suit. It has a set of loops and straps integrated into the outfit's frame - allowing for ropes and rappelling gear to be more efficiently used.  Add 2 boost dice to Athletics checks for climbing or rappel

Reflect Body Glove,0,3,2500,2,0,5,No,"This skintight suit is typically worn under normal clothing and is extremely effective in providing temporary protection by dispersing energy weapon blasts. However, as it is quite thin, the armour is particularly fragile and susceptible to wear &amp; tear. Add 2 setback dice to Vigilance and Perception checks to notice that the wearer is wearing a reflect body glove. When a combat check against the wearer is successful, reduce the soak by 1 (to a minimum of 0).

Imperial Hazard Trooper Armour,0,3,18000,4,3,8,Yes,"Imperial Storm Troopers have specialized armor for nearly every situation, and the Imperial hazardous environment protective armor, or ""hazard trooper armor"" is one of the most rugged armor suits in the corps. Using a powered armor frame similar to that of space troopers, hazard trooper armor augments the strength of the wearer and provides protection against radiation, acids, toxic chemical, and extreme pressures or vacuums. Movement in the armor is sluggish due to it's bulk, but a neural interface with the wearer's cybernetics reduces the response time to a minimum, ensuring marksmanship is unimpeded by the armor. While manufactured by the Empire for its exclusive use, hazard trooper armor often finds it's way into the hands of the Rebel Alliance. Hazard troopers are known for their incredible strength, but this actually stems from the troopers standard cybernetic enhancements rather any quality of the armor. More than a few rebel operatives have been disappointed to discover this face after claiming a set of hazard trooper armor in battle. Once active, the armor's internal life support and power systems allow the wearer to survive in radiation zones, toxic environments, and total vacuums for up to twenty four hours. The armor also incorporates a high-powered comlink able to communicate from the ground to low orbit. The helmet is equipped with a multi-frequency targeting and acquisition system which removes the [SETBACK][SETBACK] due to darkness, smoke, or similar environmental factors that obscure vision from the wearer's Perception, Vigilance, and combat checks."
Timber Cuirass,1,2,4000,4,1,5,No,"Tholothians turned to developing their own weapons and body armour following the Empire's blockades that aimed to make imported weaponry and armour prohibitively costly.

Rebel Heavy Battle Armour,1,2,6000,5,5,8,Yes,"Most Alliance field tactics focus on hit-and-fade strikes, sabotage, and denial operations, but sometimes the Rebellion has no choice but to stand and fight against Imperial forces. Unfortunately, the Rebellion lacks the manpower and weapons to dominate the Empire in field warfare. Rebel infantry uses heavy battle armor to help ensure their survival when out manned and outgunned by superior Imperial numbers. Rebel heavy battle armor is a combination of composites, laminate, and armored clothing that provides significant overall protection. The base is made of armorweave cloth to dissipate blaster bolts, and plastoid segments over top to protect from fragmentation and blunt force. The combination of materials provides heavy protection while allowing freedom of movement, unlike most full laminate battle suits.
